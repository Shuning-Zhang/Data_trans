        You are given an example dataset before the transformation {input_list} and after the transformation {output_list}.

        Your goal is to generate a Python code function that would reproduce the data transformation process,

        the code should be able to take in a different input dataset and perform the same data transformation steps.

        So don't use any specific example data inputs in the genetated code. Make sure the function name of the generated code should be "transform_data".

        Take the input in a Python list format.

        No Explanation needed in your answer and your output should be of the following format:

        Generated Code:
        Your python code and comment here.

        End of code generation!
